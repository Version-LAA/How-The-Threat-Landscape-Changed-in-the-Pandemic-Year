# How The Threat Landscape Changed in the Pandemic Year

The purpose of this analysis project is to analyze malicious domains submitted to url.abuse[.]ch for the year range of 2019 to 2020. The URL Haus project is an amazing resource used by security practicioners of all kinds to help share and provide insight into malicious urls discovered. The URLhaus project is created and managed by abuse[.]ch, a non profit security reasearch project that manages several additional projects to provide situational awareness and information to aid in internet security against malware.

The goal of this project was to analyze submissions to URL HAUS to identify which type of malware was more prominant in the year of 2020 vs 2019. The database for this analysis contains over 930,000 entries. To aid in the analysis, I will be using python and data centric libraries such as Pandas,Numpy, and Matplotlib with technical analysis work described in Jupyter Notebook. 

Some questions this project will look to answer is:

- What type of malware was more prominant in the year of the pandemic in 2020 vs the previous year in 2019?
- What are the most common top level domains seen over the past 2 years used to deliver malware?
- Based on analysis, are there any specifc threat hunts organization can perform to identify traffic going to those risky domains?
